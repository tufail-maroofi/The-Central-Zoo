        <h1>StarFish</h1>
        <p>Starfish, also known as sea stars, are fascinating creatures that belong to the phylum Echinodermata and are found in various ocean habitats worldwide. These animals are known for their unique star-like shape, with five arms radiating from a central point. Starfish are important members of the ocean ecosystem, playing a vital role in maintaining the balance of their environment. They feed on a variety of prey, including mollusks, barnacles, and mussels, which they grip with their arms and use their specialized stomachs to digest. The shape and size of their arms and spines vary greatly between species, 
          with some species growing up to three feet in diameter. Starfish are also known for their remarkable regenerative abilities, being able to grow new arms and regenerate damaged tissues. Despite their importance in the ocean, starfish populations are vulnerable to human activities such as overfishing, pollution, and climate change, making it essential for us to protect these fascinating animals and their habitats. <br> Starfish, also known as sea stars, are fascinating creatures that belong to the echinoderm family. As predators, they play an important role in maintaining balance in the ocean's ecosystem. Starfish feed on a variety of prey including mollusks, clams, mussels, and small fish.

          One of the most unique things about starfish is their method of feeding. Unlike most other predators, starfish don't have teeth or a mouth, so they use their arms to pry open their prey. Once the food is exposed, the starfish will extend its stomach through its mouth and engulf the prey.

        <h1>Leopard Shark</h1>
        <p>The Leopard Shark is a type of shark found in the Pacific Ocean, primarily along the coast of North America. They are bottom-dwelling predators that feed on a variety of prey, including bony fish, crustaceans, mollusks, and squid. In the wild, they primarily feed on small crabs, shrimps, and other crustaceans. Their diet can vary depending on their location and the availability of prey.
          Leopard Sharks are opportunistic feeders and will eat whatever prey is available to them. In captivity, they are often fed a diet of squid, krill, clams, and other seafood. It is important to provide them with a varied diet to ensure they receive all the necessary nutrients for good health.
          Their powerful jaws and sharp teeth allow them to crush the shells of their prey, allowing them to access the soft flesh inside. They have a slow metabolism and do not need to eat as frequently as other shark species. In the wild, they may only eat a few times per week.
          In conclusion, Leopard Sharks are flexible feeders that can adapt to the availability of prey in their habitat. They feed on a variety of sea creatures and in captivity, they can be fed a diet of seafood to meet their nutritional needs. <br>
          The Leopard Shark is a species of shark that is commonly found in the coastal waters of the Pacific Ocean. They are known for their distinctive spots that resemble those of a leopard, which is where they get their name. Leopard Sharks can grow up to 6 feet in length and weigh up to 60 pounds. They are usually found in shallow waters near the shore and are often seen in large groups. These sharks are known to feed on small fish and invertebrates, such as crabs, squid, and shrimp.
