        <h1>Poison Frog</h1>
        <p>Poison Frogs, also known as poison dart frogs, are a group of brightly colored amphibians that are native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. These frogs are called "poison" because they secrete toxic substances from their skin, which is used as a defense mechanism against predators.

          Poison frogs are primarily found in rainforests and lowland tropical forests, near streams and other bodies of water. They are diurnal creatures and feed mainly on small insects, such as ants and termites, which they catch with their long, sticky tongues. Some species of poison frogs are also known to feed on small crustaceans and other invertebrates.
          
          In their natural habitats, poison frogs live in or near water, and their bodies are adapted to the moist environment. They have smooth, moist skin, which helps them absorb water and maintain hydration. They also have webbed feet, which make them excellent swimmers.
          
          Poison frogs are territorial creatures and typically defend their territories against other frogs. During the breeding season, males establish territories and call out to attract mates. Once a female has been attracted, the male will mate with her, and the female will lay her eggs in a moist, protected area near water.
          
          In captivity, poison frogs can be kept in terrariums or aquariums, and they are often fed a diet of live insects, such as crickets, flies, and mealworms. It is important to maintain the proper temperature and humidity levels in the enclosure to ensure the health and well-being of the frogs. <br>
