        <h1>Tiger</h1>
        <p>Tigers, a species of big cats found in Asia, are carnivores and their diet mainly consists of large mammals such as deer, boars, and buffalos. In the wild, tigers hunt and consume their prey whole, including the bones and internal organs. They are known for their strong jaw muscles and sharp teeth, allowing them to easily crush and consume the bones of their prey.

          However, in captivity, tigers are often fed with commercially available meat products, specifically formulated for large carnivores, which provide them with the necessary nutrients and protein to maintain their health. Additionally, some zoological institutions supplement their diets with bones, whole prey items, and vitamin/mineral supplements to mimic their natural diet.
          
          It is important to note that tigers have different dietary needs based on their age, size, and health status. For example, young tigers require a diet high in protein and fat to support their growth, while elderly tigers may need a diet lower in protein to reduce the stress on their kidneys.
          Tigers, one of the largest and most powerful mammals in the cat family, are carnivores and primarily feed on large prey such as deer, wild pigs, and buffalo. In the wild, tigers are solitary hunters, using their stealth and strength to ambush their prey. They have strong jaws and sharp teeth, allowing them to bite through the thick skin and bones of their prey. However, they are also opportunistic hunters and will eat smaller prey if it is available. It is important for tigers to consume a balanced diet in order to maintain their strength and overall health. In captive environments, tigers are often fed a diet of commercial meat and poultry to ensure they receive all of the nutrients they need. It's also important to note that tigers are apex predators and play a crucial role in maintaining the balance of their ecosystem by keeping populations of their prey in check.

        <h1>Wolf</h1>
        <p>Wolves are carnivorous mammals and their primary food source is meat. They are opportunistic hunters and feed on a variety of prey including large and small mammals, birds, and fish. In the wild, wolves hunt in packs, making it easier for them to take down larger prey such as elk, deer, and moose. They will also scavenge on carrion or dead animals.

          Wolves have a very strong jaw and teeth, which they use to kill and consume their prey. They have long, sharp canines that they use to bite into the flesh of their prey and tear it apart. Their molars are also adapted to crush bones, making it easier for them to extract the nutritious marrow.
          
          In captive settings, wolves are typically fed a diet that consists of commercial meat and bone products, along with fresh fruits and vegetables. This diet is designed to provide them with the necessary nutrients and energy to maintain their health and well-being.
          
          It is important to note that the diet of wolves can vary depending on the geographical location, time of year, and availability of prey. In areas where prey is scarce, wolves may resort to scavenging or eating carrion, while in areas with abundant prey, they may have a more varied diet.
          
          Overall, the diet of wolves is crucial to their survival and it is important to ensure that they are provided with the necessary nutrients and energy to maintain their health and well-being. Whether in the wild or in captive settings, providing a balanced diet is essential for the long-term success and sustainability of these magnificent <br>
          They also hunt smaller mammals such as hares and beavers. Wolves hunt in packs, which allows them to bring down larger prey. They use their strong jaws and sharp teeth to rip apart their prey. In addition to hunting, wolves will also scavenge for carrion and feed on fruit and berries. Overall, their diet is diverse and varies depending on their habitat and availability of food sources.

        <h1>Panda</h1>
        <p> The giant panda, also known as the panda bear or simply the panda, is a bear native to central China. This unique and captivating animal is beloved around the world for its distinctive black and white fur, and is considered a symbol of peace and friendship. At The Central Zoo, we are proud to be home to a family of giant pandas, and we take great care to provide them with the best possible care and nutrition.

          When it comes to food, giant pandas have a very specific and limited diet. They are primarily bamboo eaters, with bamboo making up 99% of their diet. They will also occasionally eat other plants, small animals and even fish, but bamboo is their primary source of food. At The Central Zoo, our pandas are fed a variety of different bamboo species, as well as other types of vegetation to ensure that they are getting a balanced and nutritious diet.
          
          One of the biggest challenges when it comes to feeding giant pandas is that they are very picky eaters. They are notorious for turning their noses up at certain types of bamboo, even if they are healthy and nutritious. This means that our keepers have to be very careful when choosing the right types of bamboo to offer to our pandas. They also have to be mindful of the age and stage of growth of the bamboo, as certain parts of the plant are more palatable than others.
          
          In addition to offering our pandas a variety of different bamboo species, we also supplement their diet with other types of vegetation and even specially formulated panda cakes. These panda cakes are designed to provide the pandas with all of the nutrients and vitamins that they need, and are made using a variety of different ingredients including carrots, apples, sweet potatoes, and more. <br></p>
